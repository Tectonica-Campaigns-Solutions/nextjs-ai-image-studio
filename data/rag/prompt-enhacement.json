  "enhancement_text_1": "High-contrast halftone illustration style, using bold diagonal line patterns for shading. Foreground elements rendered in deep violet and white, with strong contour emphasis. Backgrounds feature smooth gradient transitions in purple, blue, pink, and orange tones. Geometric overlays (circles, squares, diamonds, radial lines, grids) integrated as framing devices. Flat, minimal color fills with no realistic textures. Layered composition: central subject in halftone, surrounded by abstract geometric forms. Modern, digital poster aesthetic with crisp vector-like precision. Balanced use of negative space, maintaining clarity and legibility.",
  "enhancement_text_2": "Photographic base with real people kept realistic. Bold duotone poster style with halftone line shading. Subjects rendered in high-contrast purple and white silhouettes, with diagonal or curved line textures giving a screen-printed, retro feel. Backgrounds use smooth radial gradients in vivid pink, orange, blue, and purple hues, often with simple geometric shapes (circles, stars) layered for depth. The overall mood is dynamic, modern, and activist-inspired, with strong graphic edges and minimal detail. Composition emphasizes clarity, empowerment, and energy.",
  "enhancement_text": "Make the second image have the style of the other image. Same color palette and same background. People must be kept realistic but rendered in purple and white, with diagonal or curved line textures giving a screen-printed, retro feel.",

  "sedream_enhancement_text": "Make the first image in the style of the other image. The first image should have the same color palette and same background as the second one but must be kept as it is no variants. People must be kept realistic but rendered in purple and white shades as they are in the second image with thin and soft diagonal or curved line textures over the body giving a soft screen-printed feel. Human details must be preserved. The gradient background must remain the same as it is in the second image, with no effects and with no lines over it.",
